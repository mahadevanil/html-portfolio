<hr />
<h3>1.Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. There is
  only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly
  discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of
  astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the
  right environment to sustain human life.

<h3>2.Limitless</h3>
<p>
  An action-thriller about a writer who takes an experimental drug that allows
  him to use 100% of his mind. As one man evolves into the perfect version of
  himself, forces more corrupt than he can imagine mark him for assassination.
  Out-of-work writer Eddie Morra's (Cooper) rejection by girlfriend Lindy (Abbie
  Cornish) confirms his belief that he has zero future.

<h3>3.Ready Player One</h3>
<p>
  In the year 2045, the real world is a harsh place. The only time Wade Watts
  (Tye Sheridan) truly feels alive is when he escapes to the OASIS, an immersive
  virtual universe where most of humanity spends their days. In the OASIS, you
  can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone--the only limits are your own
  imagination. The OASIS was created by the brilliant and eccentric James
  Halliday (Mark Rylance), who left his immense fortune and total control of the
  Oasis to the winner of a three-part contest he designed to find a worthy heir.
